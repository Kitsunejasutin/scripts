Scripts
=========

Usage:
 `source script-name.sh`

Bunch of homemade bash scripts which I often use to make my life easier :)  
Feel free to fork it for your own use, and I'm open to PRs if you'd like to improve something or fix issues!


* `clone-hals.sh`: Clones QCOM sm8150 HALs which I use to compile Android 11 ROMs for Ginkgo
